Project Jupiter

Please run 'npm install' everytime you pull just incase extra dependencies were installed since the last time you pulled.
Also, 'killall node' might help if you cannot connect to localhost but the server is running

Getting up and running:
1. Clone this repo
2. In your terminal type 'npm install'
3. To run the server type 'npm start'

Asides:
* The express server can found in server.js, it has a lot of comments explaining what everything does.
* EJS is just a templating engine, I think it might be a pretty simple thing to use, so look it up, but this can be easily swapped for something else right now!
* nodemon is running, so if the server is running and you make any changes to server.js it will automatically restart.
* Stop the server with 'ctrl + C' if in linux
* Text me if you have questions.
