Project Jupiter

Getting up and running:

1.) Clone this repo
2.) In your terminal type 'npm install'
3.) To run the server type 'npm start'

Asides:
    -The express server can found in server.js, it has a lot of comments explaining what everything does.
    -EJS is just a templating engine, I think it might be a pretty simple thing to use, so look it up, but this can be easily swapped for something else right now!
    -Shoot me a text if you have any questions!
