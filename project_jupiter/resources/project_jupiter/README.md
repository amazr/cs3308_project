Project Jupiter

Getting up and running:
1. Clone this repo
2. In your terminal type 'npm install'
3. To run the server type 'npm start'

Asides:
* The express server can found in server.js, it has a lot of comments explaining what everything does.
* EJS is just a templating engine, I think it might be a pretty simple thing to use, so look it up, but this can be easily swapped for something else right now!
* nodemon is running, so if the server is running and you make any changes to server.js it will automatically restart.
* Stop the server with 'ctrl + C' if in linux
* Text me if you have questions.
